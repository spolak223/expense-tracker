# Expense Tracker!!

Very proud to finally upload this to GitHub, not exactly the best of code or functionality but that's what learning is for 🙏

# What it can do:
- Add and delete expenses
- Sort expenses by name, amount or date
- All data is saved to a JSON file immediately after adding a new expenses, so basically an autosave


# First project
This is my first project in its completely raw state, it is the beginning of my dev journey and will be a cool monument to look back on when I've further advanced in my developer career


# How to run:
- Download all 3 files
- Download custom tkiner along with tkinter
- Run expense_tracker_GUI.py file


Enjoy tracking your expenses 🙏
